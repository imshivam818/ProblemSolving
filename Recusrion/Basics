1. //recursion=repeatition of same function again again 

// we will do three things while solving  a problem using recursion 
1. have faith or assume that rcursion will do this work for me
2. what is expected?
   the expectaion like we have to print n to 1 numbers
   p(5)->5,4,3,2,1
3.now faith will meet with excpectaion
   p(5)->
        it will call our funtion which is P(n-1);    
        p(4)
             -> p(3) 
                   ->p(2)
                       ->p(1)
                             ->p(0)
                              now here comes our base case to stop the call
                              and that is if n==0 we will return .
   Now we are able to slve the questio with the help of recusrion
